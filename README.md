# EDA-Loan-Status-Prediction

This project is designed to predict loan repayment status using advanced machine learning techniques. By applying classification algorithms and leveraging TensorFlow, we developed a robust solution that improves prediction accuracy. Additionally, a Flask application was developed and deployed for real-time predictions, ensuring streamlined user interaction.

# Features
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Applied classification algorithms to predict loan repayment status with high accuracy.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Used voting ensemble techniques to combine multiple models, improving reliability and generating actionable insights.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Developed and deployed a Flask-based web application to provide instant loan repayment predictions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn


## How It Works
1. **Data Preparation**: The loan dataset is preprocessed to ensure clean and structured input for the models.
2. **Model Training**: TensorFlow is used to build classification models, and ensemble learning techniques are applied to improve accuracy.
3. **Prediction**: Multiple models are combined using voting ensemble methods to enhance prediction reliability.
4. **Deployment**: The models are integrated into a Flask web application for real-time predictions and easy user interaction.

## Usage
- Input the necessary loan details into the web interface.
- Receive immediate predictions regarding the likelihood of loan repayment.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the user interface for better usability.
- Expand the feature set to incorporate more variables affecting loan repayment.
- Optimize model performance for faster predictions.
